I've created a comprehensive ARD for your automated analytics system. The document covers all the key architectural aspects including:
Key Features of the Solution:

Context Analysis Engine that automatically detects user interactions and app state changes
Event Generation Service that creates standardized events with consistent naming
Analytics Router that sends events to multiple platforms (Firebase, Amplitude, etc.)
Configuration Management for rules and naming conventions

Technical Approach:

Uses JavaScript Proxy objects and MutationObserver for automatic detection
Plugin-based architecture for easy platform integration
Rule-based engine for intelligent event generation
Microservices design for scalability

Performance Targets:

<10ms event processing time
<50MB memory footprint
<5% CPU overhead
99.9% accuracy in event generation

The system would integrate seamlessly with your existing codebase and automatically capture user interactions, form submissions, navigation events, and state changes without any manual code additions. It enforces consistent naming conventions and can route events to multiple analytics platforms simultaneously.
